    Hi, we are Lindsay and Cullen! After meeting in undergrad at Hope College (Go Dutch!)
    and dating for several years, we became engaged on August 4th, 2019.
    Cullen created this site as a means of sharing our story and plans, pictures of us,
    and a place to RSVP to any upcoming events. Feel free to read more about Our Story and view some of our highlights in the Gallery.
    We are excited you're here and hope you enjoy this site!
