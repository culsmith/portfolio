  Thanks for your investment in our love story! Here’s a recap, in case you’re newer to our lives (welcome!)
  or need a refresher (like we do, sometimes): <br>

  <p>We officially met in an English class sophomore year, though in typical
  Hope College fashion, we had some overlap in social connections.<br>
  Cullen made the first move by inviting Lindsay to watch Apocalypse Now (1979) with him,
  the first assigned film of the semester. While it wasn’t a traditional movie date,
  it was a date nonetheless. And with the exception of a few days off-the-grid,
  we haven’t stopped talking since.<br>

  Cullen: I realized I loved Lindsay when I was in the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota,
   on an annual trip with family. I was in the wilderness, totally disconnected from the rest of the world
  - and the way I missed her made me realize how much I wanted her in my life. <br>

  Lindsay: From our earliest conversations, I intuitively knew Cullen was different,
  and I had a sense that he could be in my life for a long time.
  That knowledge was revealed over months, then years - but it has always been a calm certainty.
  I first knew that I loved him when we decided to continue our relationship long-distance when I studied abroad.
  Neither of us considered letting this go. <br>

  Since then, we have walked together over long distances, through tragedies,
  across the graduation stage, into workplaces and graduate school,
  and along Lake Michigan as a newly-engaged couple.
  We now live in Ann Arbor, excited to see what’s in store in the next chapter of our story! <br>
